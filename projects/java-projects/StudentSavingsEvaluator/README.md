# StudentSavingsEvaluator

This is a Java program I created during my senior year to evaluate how much a student saves over time based on user input.

## 🎓 Project Requirement

This project was completed as part of my MIS 350 end of the semester project.  
One of the main requirements was to use **at least three methods** to structure the program logically.

## 🔍 What It Does

- Collects multiple income sources and converts them to monthly values
- Collects fixed and variable monthly expenses
- Calculates monthly savings and savings percentage
- Provides feedback based on savings behavior

## 📂 Files Included

- `StudentSavingsEvaluator1.java`: Main source code
- `StudentSavingsEvaluator1.class`: Compiled Java file

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Have Java installed on your machine.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to this folder.
3. Compile the file:
   ```bash
   javac StudentSavingsEvaluator1.java
   ```
4. Run the program:
   ```bash
   java StudentSavingsEvaluator1
   ```
