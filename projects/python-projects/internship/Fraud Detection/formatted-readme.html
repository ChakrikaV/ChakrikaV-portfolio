    <h1>Fraud Detection Project (Internship)</h1>
    <p>
      This project was completed during my internship as part of a fraud detection use case.
      The objective was to identify suspicious transactions more effectively while reducing false positives,
      giving analysts higher confidence in alerts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The project exposed me to handling <strong>real-world imbalanced data</strong>,
      <strong>feature engineering</strong>, and <strong>model evaluation</strong> in a high-stakes setting.

    <h2>📁 Files Included</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="EDA.html" target="_blank">EDA.html</a> — Exploratory Data Analysis of the transaction dataset.</li>
      <li><a href="FraudDeterction.html" target="_blank">FraudDeterction.html</a> — Model development and evaluation report.</li>
      <li>README.md — Raw project description.</li>
      <li>README.html — Formatted, portfolio-ready project description.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>📊 Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The use case focused on predicting the likelihood of fraudulent activity from transaction data.
      This project was designed to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Apply advanced machine learning models in a business context.</li>
      <li>Handle severe class imbalance and optimize for operationally relevant metrics.</li>
      <li>Deliver NDA-safe insights and summaries of model performance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🧪 Models Explored</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Logistic Regression</li>
      <li>Random Forest</li>
      <li>XGBoost</li>
      <li>Support Vector Machine (SVM)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each model was tuned and compared across multiple evaluation metrics.</p>

    <h2>⚙️ How to Run</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Open the HTML reports (<code>EDA.html</code> or <code>FraudDeterction.html</code>) directly in a browser to review the analysis.</li>
      <li>Original development was done in Jupyter Notebook with Python.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><code>pandas</code></li>
      <li><code>numpy</code></li>
      <li><code>scikit-learn</code></li>
      <li><code>xgboost</code></li>
      <li><code>matplotlib</code> / <code>seaborn</code></li>
      <li><code>SQL</code> (for initial data handling)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🔖 Notes</h2>
    <p>
      This project was part of my internship experience. All details here are <strong>NDA-safe</strong> and generalized.
      The work taught me how to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Engineer domain-specific features (e.g., velocity and frequency features).</li>
      <li>Handle class imbalance using stratified sampling and class weights.</li>
      <li>Align model outputs to real-world review capacity (e.g., tuning thresholds for Precision@K).</li>
    </ul>
