# Customer Churn Project (Internship)

This project was completed during my internship as part of a **customer churn prediction use case**. The objective was to identify customers most at risk of leaving, enabling proactive retention strategies and improving customer lifetime value.

The project exposed me to handling **real-world customer behavior data**, **feature engineering**, and **model evaluation** in a practical business setting.

## üìä Project Overview

The use case focused on predicting the likelihood of customer churn from structured customer and service data.  
This project was designed to:  
- Apply supervised machine learning to a real-world retention problem.  
- Explore feature engineering techniques to capture customer behavior.  
- Compare multiple algorithms to balance predictive power and interpretability.

## üß™ Models Explored

Several algorithms were evaluated and compared across key metrics:  
- **Logistic Regression**  
- **Decision Tree**  
- **Random Forest**  
- **XGBoost**  

Each model was tuned iteratively, with improvements demonstrated in the second notebook.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run

1. Open the HTML reports (`CustomerChurn.html` or `CustomerChurn2.html`) directly in a browser to review the analysis.  
2. Use the datasets (`churn-bigml-20.csv` or `churn-bigml-80.csv`) as needed to replicate results.  
3. Original development was done in Jupyter Notebook with Python.

### üîñ Notes

This project was part of my internship experience. All details here are **NDA-safe** and generalized. The work taught me how to:  
- Engineer features based on customer tenure, services, and billing.  
- Handle imbalanced classes using resampling and model weighting.  
- Evaluate models using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.
