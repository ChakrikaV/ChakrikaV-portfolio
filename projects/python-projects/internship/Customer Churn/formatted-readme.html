    <h1>Customer Churn Project (Internship)</h1>

    <p>
      This project was completed during my internship as part of a
      <strong>customer churn prediction use case</strong>. The objective was to identify
      customers most at risk of leaving, enabling proactive retention strategies and
      improving customer lifetime value.
    </p>
    <p>
      The project exposed me to handling <strong>real-world customer behavior data</strong>,
      <strong>feature engineering</strong>, and <strong>model evaluation</strong> in a practical
      business setting.

    <h2>📊 Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The use case focused on predicting the likelihood of customer churn from structured
      customer and service data. This project was designed to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Apply supervised machine learning to a real-world retention problem.</li>
      <li>Explore feature engineering techniques to capture customer behavior.</li>
      <li>Compare multiple algorithms to balance predictive power and interpretability.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🧪 Models Explored</h2>
    <p>Several algorithms were evaluated and compared across key metrics:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Logistic Regression</li>
      <li>Decision Tree</li>
      <li>Random Forest</li>
      <li>XGBoost</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each model was tuned iteratively, with improvements demonstrated in the second notebook.</p>

    <h2>⚙️ How to Run</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Open the HTML reports (<code>CustomerChurn.html</code> or <code>CustomerChurn2.html</code>) directly in a browser to review the analysis.</li>
      <li>Use the datasets (<code>churn-bigml-20.csv</code> or <code>churn-bigml-80.csv</code>) as needed to replicate results.</li>
      <li>Original development was done in Jupyter Notebook with Python.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><code>pandas</code></li>
      <li><code>numpy</code></li>
      <li><code>scikit-learn</code></li>
      <li><code>xgboost</code></li>
      <li><code>matplotlib</code> / <code>seaborn</code></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🔖 Notes</h2>
    <p>
      This project was part of my internship experience. All details here are
      <strong>NDA-safe</strong> and generalized. The work taught me how to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Engineer features based on customer tenure, services, and billing.</li>
      <li>Handle imbalanced classes using resampling and model weighting.</li>
      <li>Evaluate models using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.</li>
    </ul>
